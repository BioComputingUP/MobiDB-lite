THE PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH USING ANCHOR MUST INCLUDE AN APPROPRIATE
CITATION TO THE METHOD:

 Prediction of Protein Binding Regions in Disordered Proteins.

*******************************************************************************
To be able to use ANCHOR, you need to compile the C program.

TO COMPILE: 

cc anchor.c -o anchor -lm -O2

or simply type 

make


TO RUN ANCHOR AS C PROGRAM:

anchor seqfile options
  
  where seqfile is the name of the sequence file
  optional parameters:  
  -v         : produce a more detailed profile output
  -d datadir : location of anchordata file

To be able to run outside the program directory, the directory of the anchordata
file can be specified with the -d option. Alternatively, the ANCHOR_PATH 
environment variable has to be set to the location of the data file. 


INPUT FILE: sequence_file in fasta format. One sequence per file.

EXAMPLE RUN: 

anchor p27.seq -d ./


TO RUN ANCHOR AS A PERL PROGRAM:

We also provide a perl wrapper to run ANCHOR. Complementing the prediction of
disordered binding regions, this perl program can carry out simple motif
searches. Without the motif search, the output of the perl script and the C
program should be identitical.

perl anchor.pl seqfile options

  where seqfile is the name of the sequence file
  optional parameters:  
  -v         : produce a more detailed profile output
  -d datadir : location of anchordata and anchor program file
  -m motifs  : file describing the motifs. 


MOTIF SEARCH: 

The motifs should be in a separate file. The format is: 

motif [name]

where name is optional. There should be only one motif per line. For example:

F...W..[LIV]  MDM2
[RK].L.{0,1}[FYLIVMP]	CYCLIN_1
[PA][^P][^FYWIL]S[^P] USP7_1



A complete list of current ELM motifs taken from the ELM server (http://elm.eu.org/)
can be found in the file "motifs_elm.txt" converted into this format. Calmodulin
binding motifs taken from the Calmodulin Target Database
(http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/) are also provided in the "CaM_motifs.txt"
file. Other motifs can also be specified. For example a motif to find proline-rich
regions can be:

P+.?P{2,}.?P+     Poly-Proline

EXAMPLE RUN: 

perl anchor.pl p27.seq -m motifs_example.txt > p27.out

FILTERING

Currently there are two filtering criteria. Short regions with length below 6
residues and regions with an average IUPred score below 0.1 are filtered out.
This criteria decreases false positive rate on globular proteins, and eliminates
most transmembrane protein segments. The filtered regions are listed separatetly.

OUTPUT

The ouput includes the list of predicted and filtered binding regions (if any),
and the prediction profile.  If motif search was selected, the perl wrapper
output also returns the location of the found motifs. The prediction profile
gives back the probability score that indicates the likelihood of the residue to
be part of a disordered binding region along each position in the sequence.
Regions that have a score above 0.5 and pass the filtering criteria are
predicted as disordered binding regions and are marked by 1, 0 otherwise.

If the -v option was specificed, additional columns are returned in the
prediction profile. These include the IUPred probability score calculated by
IUPred, a general disorder prediction method, the ANCHOR score from which the
ANCHOR probability was calculated, and the three scores underlying ANCHOR
predictions (see the original article for more details).
