        Mathematical Morphology (MM) Erosion & Dilation implementation of

        morphological operations. Morphological Operations are part of Morphology,
        a set of image processing operations.

        Here a simple implementation of Erosion and Dilation processes are used	to
        eliminate spurious order inside disorder and vice versa. In particular,
        binary representation of order or disorder states along a protein
        sequence are treated as pixels in a mono-dimensional image. This "image"
        undergoes ``rmax`` iterations of ID dilation and ``rmax`` iterations of ID
        erosion. During each iteration the considered-context distance is around
        a region increases by one (on each side). When a region is surrounded by
        two regions with opposite state, it is changed to that state.
